This repository provides tools for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) using the LoRA or QLoRA methods more efficiently. It provides the framework to support multiple LoRA/qLoRA models fine tunning at the same time. By reusing the shared frozen-based model, we provide the framework to reduce GPU Memory usage for multiple fine-tuning models.  

## Updates
- Beta version: Support multiple LLaMA fine-tuning via LORA in one GPU 

## Overview

<center><img src="./assets/ASPEN-LoRA.png" width="50%"></center>

**ASPEN** is written in Python3 and compatible with HuggingFace-Transformers LLaMA Models.

This picture shows the basic principle of Multi-LoRA.

### Disadvantages of LoRA-based Approaches:
- Memory Consumption: Some Lora techniques might be efficient, but the introduction of low-rank approximations can sometimes heighten memory usage, particularly if one has to store both original and approximated parameters.

- Potential for Reduced Model Accuracy: Lora-based fine-tuning is designed to either maintain or boost model accuracy. However, there can be instances where the approximations cause a dip in performance, especially if the low-rank approximations aren't chosen carefully.

- Dependence on Hyperparameters: Much like other ML techniques, Lora-based strategies involve hyperparameters that need precise fine-tuning. Mistakes in this area can lead to subpar performance.

### Improvements in LoRA-based Approaches:
- GPU Memory Conservation: Leveraging the base model more can help in significant GPU memory conservation, an essential aspect for efficient operations.
- Automatic Parameter Learning: Introducing automation in the learning process for hyperparameters during model fine-tuning can speed up the process and guarantee optimal model results.
- Early Stopping Mechanism: Implementing this approach ensures no overfitting occurs, and resources are utilized effectively. It stops training once the model's improvement becomes negligible.

### Use Cases:
- Domain-Specific Fine-Tuning: This involves adapting a single model with various parameters particularly for one domain.
- Cross-Domain Fine-Tuning: This method leverages the base model to fine-tune multiple models, each intended for a different domain.

## Quickstart

Firstly, you should clone this repository and install dependencies:
```bash
# Clone Repository
git clone https://github.com/TUDB-Labs/multi-lora-fine-tune
cd multi-lora-fine-tune
git submodule update --init
# Install requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The `mlora.py` code is a starting point for finetuning on various datasets.
Basic command for finetuning a baseline model on the Alpaca dataset:
```bash
python mlora.py \
  --base_model decapoda-research/llama-7b-hf \
  --config ./config/alpaca.json \
  --load_8bit true
```

You can check the template finetune configuration in [template](./template/) folder.

For further detailed usage information, please use `--help` option:
```bash
python mlora.py --help
```
## Installation
You can also install ASPEN into your environment:
```bash
# Optional but recommended
conda create -n aspen_env python=3.8
conda activate aspen_env
# Install requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
After installation, you can use ASPEN directly in your code:
```python
import aspen
```
