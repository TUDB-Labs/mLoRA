ASPEN (a.k.a Multi-Lora Fine-Tune) is an open-source framework for fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) using the efficient multiple LoRA/QLoRA methods. Key features of ASPEN include:

- Efficient LoRA/QLoRA: Optimizes the fine-tuning process, significantly reducing GPU memory usage by leveraging a shared frozen-based model.

- Multiple LoRA Adapters: Support for concurrent fine-tuning of multiple LoRA/QLoRA adapters.

## Overview

**ASPEN** is a high-throughput LLM fine-tuning framework based on LoRA and QLoRA, compatible with HuggingFace-Transformers LLaMA Models and ChatGLM Models.

This picture shows the basic principle of Multi-LoRA.

ASPEN requires [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) and [NVIDIA CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit) compatible GPUs.

### Main Contribution

- Introduces the Multi-LoRA method, capable of enabling the sharing of pre-trained model weights during the fine-tuning process of large language models;
- Proposes a task scheduling algorithm to enhance the overall throughput of the task training process and reduce total training latency;
- Builds upon the above by implementing ASPEN, a high-throughput large language model fine-tuning framework based on LoRA and QLoRA;
- Evaluates ASPEN in experiments against existing systems, confirming that ASPEN effectively utilizes system computing resources, thereby improving training throughput and reducing training latency compared to current systems.

### Experiment Results

Environment: NVIDIA RTX A6000 with Intel Xeon Silver 4314 on Ubuntu 22.04.3

Baseline: We utilized the widely adopted [Alpaca-LoRA](https://github.com/tloen/alpaca-lora) as a foundation. On a single GPU, we independently ran multiple Alpaca-LoRA processes in parallel (marked as *Baseline@SYNC*) and sequentially (marked as *Baseline@SEQ*), forming two baseline methods for the experiments.

#### Training Latency

Method|Latency|Throughput
:---:|:---:|:---:
Baseline@SEQ|10.51h|608.41 token/s
Baseline@SYNC|9.85h|649.30 token/s
ASPEN|9.46h|674.58 token/s

We conducted four identical fine-tuning jobs with same dataset and same hyper-parameters, incorporating two baselines and ASPEN. During the experimental process, we collected the completion times for each task in the baseline methods and calculated the time taken by the slowest task as the *Training Latency*. As shown in Table, ASPEN exhibits lower *Training Latency* compared to both baseline methods. Specifically, ASPEN is 9.99% faster than *Baseline@SEQ* and 3.92% faster than *Baseline@SYNC*.

#### Video Memory Usage

<div align="center"><img src="./assets/Exp-Mem.png" width="75%"></div>

We conducted several fine-tuning jobs with same dataset and `batch_size = {4, 6, 8}`, incorporating  *Baseline@SYNC* and ASPEN. 

*Baseline@SYNC* triggered OOM error after 3 parallel tasks when batch size = 8, while ASPEN can handle twice that amount.

#### Batching Strategies

Method|Training Latency|Peak Memory Usage|Average GPU Utilization|Training Throughput
:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:
Baseline@SEQ|27.73h|10.68GB|79.39%|653.35 token/s
ASPEN@M1|36.82h|23.82GB|96.52%|672.54 token/s
ASPEN@M2|39.14h|23.86GB|96.41%|671.28 token/s
ASPEN@M3|22.97h|23.85GB|95.22%|674.41 token/s

We conducted four fine-tuning jobs with different dataset but same hyper-parameters, incorporating  *Baseline@SEQ* and ASPEN. 

During the experimental process, we collected following metrics:
 + *Training Latency* = Job completion time
 + *Throughput* = The number of passed tokens in model forward process / training latency
 + *Memory Usage* = Peak video memory usage
 + *GPU Utilization* = Average GPU utilization

All metrics are computed for each job. `M1, M2, M3` represent three batch strategies of ASPEN: *Optimal-Fit, Trivial, and Fast-Fit*. `BASELINE` denotes *Baseline@SEQ*.

The *Optimal-Fit* strategy performs the best across all four metrics, while the other two strategies also outperform the baseline method other than training latency.

### Use Cases:
- Domain-Specific Fine-Tuning: This involves adapting a single model with various parameters particularly for one domain.
- Cross-Domain Fine-Tuning: This method leverages the base model to fine-tune multiple models, each intended for a different domain.

## Quickstart

Firstly, you should clone this repository and install dependencies:
```bash
# Clone Repository
git clone https://github.com/TUDB-Labs/multi-lora-fine-tune
cd multi-lora-fine-tune
# Install requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The `mlora.py` code is a starting point for finetuning on various datasets.
Basic command for finetuning a baseline model on the [Alpaca Cleaned](https://github.com/gururise/AlpacaDataCleaned) dataset:
```bash
python mlora.py \
  --base_model decapoda-research/llama-7b-hf \
  --config ./config/alpaca.json \
  --load_8bit
```

You can check the template finetune configuration in [template](./template/) folder.

For further detailed usage information, please use `--help` option:
```bash
python mlora.py --help
```
## Demo on Colab
You can run finetune on Colab by following this example: [Google Colab Example](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/13ABrrcOv5iG1TCdKGZvxy9QN6YwPpOoI?usp=sharing). Make sure to switch the runtime environment to GPU before running it.
## Installation
You can also install ASPEN into your environment:
```bash
# Optional but recommended
conda create -n aspen_env python=3.8
conda activate aspen_env
# Install requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
After installation, you can use ASPEN directly in your code:
```python
import aspen
```
