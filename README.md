mLoRA (a.k.a Multi-LoRA Fine-Tune) is an open-source framework designed for efficient fine-tuning of multiple Large Language Models (LLMs) using LoRA and its variants. Key features of mLoRA include:

- Concurrent fine-tuning of multiple LoRA adapters.

- Shared base model among multiple LoRA adapters.

- Efficient pipeline parallelism algorithm.

- Support for multiple LoRA variant algorithms and various base models.

- Support for multiple reinforcement learning preference alignment algorithms.

The end-to-end architecture of the mLoRA is shown in the figure:

## Quickstart

Firstly, you should clone this repository and install dependencies (or use our image):
```bash
# Clone Repository
git clone https://github.com/TUDB-Labs/mLoRA
cd mLoRA
# Install requirements need the Python >= 3.12
pip install .
```

The `mlora_train.py` code is a starting point for batch fine-tuning LoRA adapters.
```bash
python mlora_train.py \
  --base_model TinyLlama/TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v0.4 \
  --config demo/lora/lora_case_1.yaml
```

You can check the adapters' configuration in [demo](./demo/) folder, there are some configuration regarding the use of different LoRA variants and reinforcement learning preference alignment algorithms.

For further detailed usage information, please use `--help` option:
```bash
python mlora_train.py --help
```

## Quickstart with Docker
mLoRA offers an official Docker image for quick start and development, The image is available on Dockerhub Packages registry.

First, you should pull the latest image (the image also use for development):
```bash
docker pull yezhengmaolove/mlora:latest
```
Deploy and enter a container to run mLoRA:
```bash
docker run -itd --runtime nvidia --gpus all \
    -v ~/your_dataset_dir:/dataset \
    -v ~/your_model_dir:/model \
    -p <host_port>:22 \
    --name mlora \
    yezhengmaolove/mlora:latest
# when the container started, use the ssh to login
# the default password is mlora@123
ssh root@localhost -p <host_port>
# pull the latest code and run the mlora
cd /mLoRA
git pull
python mlora_train.py \
  --base_model TinyLlama/TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v0.4 \
  --config demo/lora/lora_case_1.yaml
```

## Deploy as service with Docker
We can deploy mLoAR as a service to continuously receive user requests and perform fine-tuning task.

First, you should pull the latest image (for deploy):

```bash
docker pull yezhengmaolove/mlora:deploy_latest
```

Deploy our mLoRA server:
```bash
docker run -itd --runtime nvidia --gpus all \
    -v ~/your_dataset_cache_dir:/cache \
    -v ~/your_model_dir:/model \
    -p <host_port>:8000 \
    --name mlora_server \
    -e "BASE_MODEL=TinyLlama/TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v0.4" \
    -e "STORAGE_DIR=/cache" \
    yezhengmaolove/mlora:deploy_latest
```

Once the service is deployed, install and use `mlora_cli.py` to interact with the server.

```bash
# install the client tools
pip install mlora-cli
```

## Why you should use mLoRA

Using mLoRA can save significant computational and memory resources when training multiple adapters simultaneously.

### High performance on consumer hardware
We fine-tuned multiple LoRA adapters using four A6000 graphics cards with fp32 precision and without using checkpointing and any quantization techniques: 

| Model                                                               | mLoRA (tokens/s) | PEFT-LoRA with FSDP (tokens/s) | PEFT-LoRA with TP (tokens/s) |
