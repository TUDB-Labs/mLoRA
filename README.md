mLoRA (a.k.a Multi-LoRA Fine-Tune) is an open-source framework designed for efficient fine-tuning of multiple Large Language Models (LLMs) using LoRA and its variants. Key features of mLoRA include:

- Concurrent fine-tuning of multiple LoRA adapters.

- Shared base model among multiple LoRA adapters.

- Efficient pipeline parallelism algorithm.

- Support for multiple LoRA variant algorithms and various base models.

- Support for multiple reinforcement learning preference alignment algorithms.

## Quickstart

Firstly, you should clone this repository and install dependencies:
```bash
# Clone Repository
git clone https://github.com/TUDB-Labs/mLoRA
cd mLoRA
# Install requirements
pip install .
```

The `mlora.py` code is a starting point for batch fine-tuning LoRA adapters.
```bash
python mlora.py \
  --base_model TinyLlama/TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v0.4 \
  --config demo/lora/lora_case_1.yaml
```

You can check the adapters' configuration in [demo](./demo/) folder, there are some configuration regarding the use of different LoRA variants and reinforcement learning preference alignment algorithms.

For further detailed usage information, please use `--help` option:
```bash
python mlora.py --help
```

## Deploy as service
We can deploy mLoAR as a service to continuously receive user requests and perform fine-tuning task.

[![asciicast](https://asciinema.org/a/IifqdtBoJAVP4r8wg1lrcm9LI.svg)](https://asciinema.org/a/IifqdtBoJAVP4r8wg1lrcm9LI)

```bash
# Install requirements for deploy
pip install .[deploy]
# Start the server
python mlora_server.py \
  --base_model /data/TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0/ \
  --root /tmp/mlora
```
For further detailed usage information, please use `--help` option:

```bash
python mlora_server.py --help
```

Once the service is deployed, use `mlora_cli.py` to interact with the server.

```bash
python mlora_cli.py
```

## Why you should use mLoRA

Using mLoRA can save significant computational and memory resources when training multiple adapters simultaneously.

### High performance on consumer hardware
We fine-tuned multiple LoRA adapters using four A6000 graphics cards with fp32 precision and without using checkpointing and any quantization techniques: 

| Model                                                               | mLoRA (tokens/s) | PEFT-LoRA with FSDP (tokens/s) | PEFT-LoRA with TP (tokens/s) |
