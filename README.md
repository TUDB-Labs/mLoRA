m-LoRA (a.k.a Multi-Lora Fine-Tune) is an open-source framework for fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) using the efficient multiple LoRA/QLoRA methods. Key features of m-LoRA include:

- Efficient LoRA/QLoRA: Optimizes the fine-tuning process, significantly reducing GPU memory usage by leveraging a shared frozen-based model.

- Multiple LoRA Adapters: Support for concurrent fine-tuning of multiple LoRA/QLoRA adapters.

## Overview

**m-LoRA** is a high-throughput LLM fine-tuning framework based on LoRA and QLoRA, compatible with HuggingFace-Transformers LLaMA Models and ChatGLM Models.

This picture shows the basic principle of LoRA and Multi-LoRA.

The system overview of m-LoRA is as follows.
<div align="center"><img src="./assets/system_overview.png" width="100%"></div>

m-LoRA requires [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) and [NVIDIA CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit) compatible GPUs.

### Main Contribution

- Introduces the Multi-LoRA method, capable of enabling the sharing of pre-trained model weights during the fine-tuning process of large language models;
- Proposes a task scheduling algorithm to enhance the overall throughput of the task training process and reduce total training latency;
- Builds upon the above by implementing m-LoRA, a high-throughput large language model fine-tuning framework based on LoRA and QLoRA;
- Evaluates m-LoRA in experiments against existing systems, confirming that m-LoRA effectively utilizes system computing resources, thereby improving training throughput and reducing training latency compared to current systems.

### Experiment Results

Environment: NVIDIA RTX A6000 with Intel Xeon Silver 4314 on Ubuntu 22.04.3

Baseline: We utilized the widely adopted [Alpaca-LoRA](https://github.com/tloen/alpaca-lora) as a foundation. On a single GPU, we independently ran multiple Alpaca-LoRA processes in parallel (marked as *Baseline@Alpaca-Parallel*) and sequentially (marked as *Baseline@Alpaca-Seq*), forming two baseline methods for the experiments. We test this on A100, and rest of results are based on the same GPU configure.

#### Training Latency and Throughput

Method|Latency|Throughput
:---:|:---:|:---:
Baseline@Alpaca-Seq|10.51h|608.41 token/s
Baseline@Alpaca-Parallel|9.85h|649.30 token/s
m-LoRA|9.46h|674.58 token/s

We conducted four identical fine-tuning jobs with same dataset and same hyper-parameters, incorporating two baselines and m-LoRA. During the experimental process, we collected the completion times for each task in the baseline methods and calculated the time taken by the slowest task as the *Training Latency*. As shown in Table, m-LoRA exhibits lower *Training Latency* compared to both baseline methods. Specifically, m-LoRA is 9.99% faster than *Baseline@Alpaca-Seq* and 3.92% faster than *Baseline@Alpaca-Parallel*.

#### Video Memory Usage
<div align="center"><img src="./assets/GPU_memory_usage.png" width="100%"></div>

We conducted several fine-tuning jobs with same dataset and `batch_size = {2,4, 6, 8}`, incorporating  *Baseline@Alpaca-Parallel* and m-LoRA. 

*Baseline@Alpaca-Parallel* triggered OOM error after 3 parallel tasks when batch size = 8, while m-LoRA can handle twice that amount.

#### Batching Strategies

Method|Training Latency|Peak Memory Usage|Average GPU Utilization|Training Throughput
:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:
Baseline@Alpaca-Seq|27.73h|10.68GB|79.39%|653.35 token/s
m-LoRA@M1|36.82h|23.82GB|96.52%|672.54 token/s
m-LoRA@M2|39.14h|23.86GB|96.41%|671.28 token/s
m-LoRA@M3|22.97h|23.85GB|95.22%|674.41 token/s

We conducted four fine-tuning jobs with different dataset but same hyper-parameters, incorporating  *Baseline@Alpaca-Seq* and m-LoRA. 

During the experimental process, we collected following metrics:
 + *Training Latency* = Job completion time
 + *Throughput* = The number of passed tokens in model forward process / training latency
 + *Memory Usage* = Peak video memory usage
 + *GPU Utilization* = Average GPU utilization

All metrics are computed for each job. `M1, M2, M3` represent three batch strategies of m-LoRA: *Optimal-Fit, Trivial, and Fast-Fit*. `BASELINE` denotes *Baseline@Alpaca-Seq*.

The *Optimal-Fit* strategy performs the best across all four metrics, while the other two strategies also outperform the baseline method other than training latency.
### Use Cases:
- Domain-Specific Fine-Tuning: This involves adapting a single model with various parameters particularly for one domain.
- Cross-Domain Fine-Tuning: This method leverages the base model to fine-tune multiple models, each intended for a different domain.

## Quickstart

Firstly, you should clone this repository and install dependencies:
```bash
# Clone Repository
git clone https://github.com/TUDB-Labs/multi-lora-fine-tune
cd multi-lora-fine-tune
# Install requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The `mlora.py` code is a starting point for finetuning on various datasets.
Basic command for finetuning a baseline model on the [Alpaca Cleaned](https://github.com/gururise/AlpacaDataCleaned) dataset:
```bash
python mlora.py \
  --base_model yahma/llama-7b-hf \
  --config ./config/alpaca.json \
  --load_8bit
```

You can check the template finetune configuration in [template](./template/) folder.

For further detailed usage information, please use `--help` option:
```bash
python mlora.py --help
```
## Demo on Colab
You can run finetune on Colab by following this example: [Google Colab Example](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/13ABrrcOv5iG1TCdKGZvxy9QN6YwPpOoI?usp=sharing). Make sure to switch the runtime environment to GPU before running it.
## Installation
You can also install m-LoRA into your environment:
```bash
# Optional but recommended
conda create -n mlora_env python=3.8
conda activate mlora_env
# Install requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
After installation, you can use m-LoRA directly in your code:
```python
import mlora
```
