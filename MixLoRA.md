# MixLoRA: Resource-Efficient Model with Mix-of-Experts Architecture for Enhanced LoRA Performance

<div align="left"><img src="./assets/Mix-LoRA.png" width=60%"></div>

The fundamental concept of MixLoRA is based on a pre-trained model with all parameters frozen, such as LLaMA-7B. It involves training multiple LoRA expert modules on top of its fully connected layer (FFN). Simultaneously, a routing layer (Gate Linear) is trained, creating a more powerful Mixture of Experts (MoE) language model. Theoretically, this approach allows achieving performance similar to existing MoE models but with fewer resources.

In addition, MixLoRA also allows simultaneous fine-tuning of the attention layer, contributing to improved fine-tuning outcomes. In experiments, when the attention layer is fine-tuned simultaneously, the MixLoRA model composed of 8 experts exhibits a faster rate of loss reduction compared to the MixLoRA model with 9 experts.

MixLoRA exists within m-LoRA in a specific adapter form. Consequently, m-LoRA is capable of simultaneously loading, training, and fine-tuning multiple distinct MixLoRA models. However, it's essential to note that these models must be based on the same pre-trained model.

## Create MixLoRA model

Basic command for creating a baseline model on the [Alpaca Cleaned](https://github.com/gururise/AlpacaDataCleaned) dataset:
```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python mlora.py \
  --base_model yahma/llama-7b-hf \
  --config ./config/alpaca_mixlora.json \
  --load_8bit
```
Please note that once the MixLoRA model is created, the number of experts in the model cannot be changed.

## Fine-tuning MixLoRA model

The MixLoRA model can also undergo further fine-tuning.
Basic command for finetuning a model on the [Alpaca Cleaned](https://github.com/gururise/AlpacaDataCleaned) dataset:
```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python mlora.py \
  --base_model yahma/llama-7b-hf \
  --config ./config/alpaca_mixlora.json \
  --load_adapter \
  --load_8bit
```

## Evaluate MixLoRA model

Currently, MixLoRA supports evaluation only through the m-LoRA framework.
```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python mlora.py \
  --base_model yahma/llama-7b-hf \
  --config ./config/alpaca_mixlora.json \
  --load_adapter \
  --load_8bit \
  --inference
```
